# üêâ Dragon Curve Fractal Generator

## Overview

This project visualizes the **Dragon Curve**, a self-similar fractal known for its intricate, space-filling patterns. The Dragon Curve can be constructed through recursive methods, such as Lindenmayer systems (L-systems), or by iteratively folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and unfolding it at right angles. This implementation employs a recursive algorithm to generate and display the curve up to a specified iteration depth.

## Features

- **Recursive Generation**: Builds the Dragon Curve using a recursive algorithm, allowing for exploration of its fractal nature.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Renders the curve graphically, enabling users to observe its complexity at various iteration levels.
- **Customizable Depth**: Users can specify the number of iterations to control the detail and complexity of the generated curve.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Graphics Library**: Turtle Graphics, MatPlotLib

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
